# Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
## Background information
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space. In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyze the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy.

## Tasks
Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to the ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

## Folder Task 1

# Task 2: Data Insights
Targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.
## Background information
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have a prior transaction history with the organization. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analyzed, the data would reveal useful customer insights that could help optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high-value customers.

## Tasks
Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address, and transactions) as a labeled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization. 

In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the approach that we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3-week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

## Folder Task 2

# Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
Using visualizations to present insights
## Background information
The client is happy with the analysis plan and would like us to proceed.  After building the model we need to present our results back to the client. 

Visualizations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas more concisely. A list of customers or algorithm won’t cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualizations. 

## Tasks
Please develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance).  A maximum of 3 dashboard views/tabs, creativity in layout and presentation is welcome.
